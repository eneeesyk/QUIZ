# QUIZ GAME :raised_hand:
    UPDATED!
    I have created a quiz game with python. It has 25 questions and each of them in the computer science category. Good luck with the quiz and don't forget to FUN!
    I used this api endpoint https://opentdb.com/api.php for get the datas. You can check that out in my codes.

## PRINCIPLES :eyes:
    - The game has only boolean questions.
    - Give your answer which you think is correct.
    - If your answer is true the screen will be green.
    - If your answer is not true the screen will be red.
    - The game tracks your score.
    - In final you can see your score on the screen.
